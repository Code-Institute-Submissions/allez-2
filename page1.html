                            <p class="lead">The 1977 final was the first time Liverpool and Borussia Mönchengladbach had reached the showpiece match. The clubs had faced each other before in the final of a European competition; the 1973 UEFA Cup Final. A match which Liverpool won 3–2 on aggregate.[11] Despite this being both clubs' first European Cup final they had both won European competitions. In addition to their UEFA Cup victory over Borussia, Liverpool had won the previous season's UEFA Cup, beating Club Brugge 4–3 on aggregate.[12] Borussia were successful in the 1974–75 UEFA Cup; they beat FC Twente of the Netherlands 5–1 on aggregate.[13]
                                            Liverpool entered the match as English champions; they had won the 1976–77 Football League for a record tenth time by a single point from Manchester City and Ipswich Town.[14] Liverpool had also progressed to the final of the 1976–77 FA Cup against Manchester United. Liverpool had the opportunity to win an unprecedented Treble of League, FA Cup and European Cup. However, it was not to be as Liverpool lost the FA Cup final 2–1.[15] Borussia entered the match as German champions; they had won the 1976–77 Fußball-Bundesliga by a single point from Schalke and Eintracht Braunschweig.[16] Borussia were aiming to become the second German team to win the European Cup after Bayern Munich had won the three previous finals.[17]
                                            The first chance of the match was for Borussia; Rainer Bonhof saw his shot come back off the post. In the 24th minute, Borussia player Herbert Wimmer suffered an injury and had to be replaced by Christian Kulik.[18] Three minutes later Ian Callaghan won the ball in midfield and passed to Steve Heighway on the right wing. Heighway cut inside from a wing and passed into space for Terry McDermott who scored the opening goal of the match.[19] Borussia began to exert more of an influence on the game after Liverpool's goal, however they were unable to equalise before the end of the first half.[19]
                                            Seven minutes after the restart Borussia had equalised. A stray Jimmy Case pass was picked up by Allan Simonsen, who advanced towards goal and scored to level the match at 1–1. Moments later, Liverpool thought they had won a penalty when Kevin Keegan seemed to have been brought down by Berti Vogts, however the referee waved play on.[18] Five minutes after their goal, Simonsen crossed the ball from the wing, it was met by Uli Stielike whose shot was saved by Liverpool goalkeeper Ray Clemence.[18] Two minutes later Liverpool regained the lead. They won a corner on the left side of the pitch, Heighway delivered the ball into the penalty area, which was met at the near post by Tommy Smith to give Liverpool a 2–1 lead in what was his 600th appearance for the club.[20] Soon afterwards Bonhof appeared to have brought Heighway down in the penalty area, but the referee again waved play on.[19] However, in the 82nd minute Liverpool were awarded a penalty when Vogts brought Kevin Keegan down. Phil Neal scored the subsequent penalty to give Liverpool a 3–1 lead.[21] No further goals were scored and Liverpool won their first European Cup.</p>
