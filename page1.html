							<h1 class="display-4"><strong>1977</strong></h1>
							<p class="lead">The 1977 final was the first time Liverpool and Borussia Mönchengladbach had
								reached the showpiece match.
								The clubs had faced each other before in the final of a European competition; the 1973
								UEFA Cup Final.
								A match which Liverpool won 3–2 on aggregate.

								Liverpool entered the match as English champions; they had won the 1976–77 Football
								League for a record tenth
								time by a single point from Manchester City and Ipswich Town. Liverpool had also
								progressed to the final of the
								1976–77 FA Cup against Manchester United. Liverpool had the opportunity to win an
								unprecedented Treble of League,
								FA Cup and European Cup. However, it was not to be as Liverpool lost the FA Cup final
								2–1.

								The first chance of the match was for Borussia; Rainer Bonhof saw his shot come back off
								the post. In the 24th
								minute, Borussia player Herbert Wimmer suffered an injury and had to be replaced by
								Christian Kulik. Three minutes
								later Ian Callaghan won the ball in midfield and passed to Steve Heighway on the right
								wing. Heighway cut inside
								from a wing and passed into space for Terry McDermott who scored the opening goal of the
								match. Borussia began to
								exert more of an influence on the game after Liverpool's goal, however they were unable
								to equalise before the end
								of the first half.

								Seven minutes after the restart Borussia had equalised. A stray Jimmy Case pass was
								picked up by Allan Simonsen, who
								advanced towards goal and scored to level the match at 1–1. Moments later, Liverpool
								thought they had won a penalty
								when Kevin Keegan seemed to have been brought down by Berti Vogts, however the referee
								waved play on. Five minutes after
								their goal, Simonsen crossed the ball from the wing, it was met by Uli Stielike whose
								shot was saved by Liverpool goalkeeper
								Ray Clemence. Two minutes later Liverpool regained the lead. They won a corner on the
								left side of the pitch, Heighway
								delivered the ball into the penalty area, which was met at the near post by Tommy Smith
								to give Liverpool a 2–1 lead in
								what was his 600th appearance for the club. Soon afterwards Bonhof appeared to have
								brought Heighway down in the penalty
								area, but the referee again waved play on. However, in the 82nd minute Liverpool were
								awarded a penalty when Vogts brought
								Kevin Keegan down. Phil Neal scored the subsequent penalty to give Liverpool a 3–1 lead.
								No further goals were scored and
								Liverpool won their first European Cup.</p>

							<h1 class="display-4"><strong>1978</strong></h1>
							<p class="lead">The first half was dull. Brugge held back, using tight marking and the
								offside trap to restrict Liverpool's attacking threat.
								Towards the end of the first half, Liverpool started to have more scoring chances. Ray
								Kennedy volleyed across the face of the
								goal, and Jimmy Case took a free kick that needed to be punched away by Brugge
								goalkeeper Birger Jensen. In the closing minutes
								of the first half, Jensen made two crucial saves: he blocked David Fairclough, who had
								made a run towards goal, and he tipped a
								header by Alan Hansen over the crossbar. So the score at half-time was 0–0.

								Early in the second half, Jensen made another save, this time from Terry McDermott.
								Brugge's first significant chance came a few
								minutes afterwards, when a cross-field pass by René Vandereycken reached Jan Sørensen on
								the right-hand side of the pitch. Sørensen's
								subsequent shot was blocked by Liverpool captain Emlyn Hughes. The blocked shot was not
								cleared, but Ray Clemence reached the ball
								before Brugge's Lajos Kű could reach it and score. After this Kű was substituted with
								Dirk Sanders. Liverpool made a substitution
								minutes later, with Steve Heighway replacing Case. Liverpool's substitution had more
								effect, as Heighway gave Liverpool more width
								on the right-hand side of the pitch. Two minutes after Heighway's introduction, Kenny
								Dalglish received the ball in the Brugge penalty
								area from a Graeme Souness pass and placed his shot over a diving Jensen to give
								Liverpool a 1–0 lead.

								Brugge now needed to score, but they only created one more chance. Ten minutes before
								the end of the match, Sørensen intercepted a
								Hansen backpass and shot. His shot was blocked by Clemence, and a goal-line clearance by
								Phil Thompson prevented Brugge from equalising.
								The match remained at 1–0 and Liverpool won their second consecutive European Cup,
								becoming the first British team to retain the trophy.

							<h1 class="display-4"><strong>1981</strong></h1>
							<p class="lead">Liverpool controlled the opening passages of the game. Their first
								goalscoring chance came in the 11th
								minute when Alan Kennedy's 30 yard shot was saved by Real goalkeeper Agustín Rodríguez.
								Further chances
								were created, but neither Terry McDermott or Dalglish were able to score. Real started
								to exert more of an
								influence after this, midfielder Juanito started to cause Liverpool problems with his
								passing. One pass
								found José Antonio Camacho who beat Liverpool defender Alan Hansen but put his shot wide
								of the Liverpool
								goal. Despite their scoring opportunity, one problem Real had was to get the best out of
								their winger Cunningham.
								Not fully fit, he was tightly marked and made little impact in the match.

								Liverpool had a chance to take the lead before half-time. Phil Neal advanced down the
								right hand side of the
								pitch and found Dalglish who passed to Graeme Souness, who ran late through the Real
								defence. His subsequent
								shot was not held by Agustín Rodríguez, but Souness was unable to get to the rebounded
								ball. Real had the first
								chance of the second half. Liverpool's defence had stopped as they thought Cunningham
								was offside, however he was
								not and Camacho advanced towards Ray Clemence in the Liverpool goal. Clemence came off
								his line and ran towards
								the Real midfielder, Camacho attempted to lob the ball over the keeper, but his shot
								went over the goal.

								The tactical approaches of the two sides were cancelling each other out. Real's slow
								pace interspersed with high
								speed bursts, while Liverpool preferred a more deliberate approach, keeping possession
								and making use of their wingers.
								Their various forms of marking also negated each other, Real man marked Liverpool's best
								players such as Dalglish
								and Souness, while Liverpool were content for the nearest defender to mark the man on
								the ball.

								Despite the tactical battle Liverpool were able to score in the 81st minute. A throw-in
								from Ray Kennedy found Alan
								Kennedy, whose run up the left hand side of the pitch caught Real off-guard. Kennedy
								went past Real defender Rafael
								García Cortés into the Real box, his subsequent shot beat the Real goalkeeper to give
								Liverpool the lead. Soon afterwards
								Liverpool replaced Dalglish with midfielder Jimmy Case in an attempt to see out the
								match. Although Liverpool had chances
								to extend their lead as Real went all out to score, Real keeper Agustín Rodríguez made a
								number of saves to keep his team
								in the game. The score remained 1–0 and Liverpool won their third European Cup, the
								first English club to do so. Liverpool's
								victory meant that Bob Paisley became the first manager to win the European Cup three
								times.</p>

							<h1 class="display-4"><strong>1984</strong></h1>
							<p class="lead">The opening passages of the match were tentative. Faced with a hostile
								atmosphere, Liverpool were content to sit back and frustrate Roma.
								Despite this tactic, Liverpool took the lead in the 15th minute. Souness and Sammy Lee
								exchanged passes before passing to Craig Johnston
								on the right hand side of the pitch. Johnston played a high cross into the Roma penalty
								area, which was challenged for by Roma goalkeeper
								Franco Tancredi and Ronnie Whelan. The result was that Tancredi dropped the ball, Roma
								defenders tried to clear the ball, but Michele Nappi's
								attempted clearance bounced off Tancredi's back and fell to Liverpool defender Phil Neal
								who scored to give Liverpool a 1–0 lead. Two minutes
								later, Souness volleyed the ball into the Roma goal from close range, but his goal was
								disallowed for offside.

								Roma had a chance to equalise in the 27th minute, but Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce
								Grobbelaar saved Conti's low shot. Neal was shown a yellow
								card in the 32nd minute for bringing down Conti, and a few minutes later Liverpool had
								an opportunity to extend their lead. Liverpool striker
								Rush charged down Dario Bonetti's clearance and ran onto the ball, but his shot was
								saved by Tancredi. With minutes remaining until half-time,
								Roma equalised. Sebastiano Nela passed to Conti, who ran down the left-hand side of the
								pitch. His first attempt at crossing the ball into the
								penalty area was blocked by a combination of Neal and Mark Lawrenson, but his cross
								rebounded back to him. His second attempt found Roberto Pruzzo
								in the penalty area, whose glancing header went into the Liverpool goal to level the
								scores at 1–1.

								Roma came out for the second half buoyed by their equaliser and they started the half
								the better of the two sides. Despite this, they were unable
								to break down the Liverpool defence, with Lawrenson in particular performing well. Roma
								began to control the midfield with the Brazilian duo Falcão
								and Toninho Cerezo combining to combat Souness in the Liverpool midfield. Roma's best
								chance of this period was a 25 yards (23 m) shot from Falcão
								which Grobbelaar saved. Roma began to lose control of the period, with both sides
								abandoning their initial game plans for fearing of conceding a goal.
								Liverpool substituted striker Johnston with defender Steve Nicol in the 72nd minute. The
								best chance of the half came in the 85th minute; Kenny Dalglish
								found Nicol in the Roma penalty area, but his shot was saved by Tancredi. The scores
								stayed level throughout the remainder of the half, which meant that
								the match would go into extra-time.

								Extra time provided little action; the only player that looked like changing the
								scoreline was Conti, whose runs at Neal caused the Liverpool defender
								problems. Despite this, the score remained the same through the 30 minutes of extra time
								and the match went to a penalty-shoot-out. Liverpool were the
								first to take a penalty, but Nicol put his shot over the crossbar. Graziani stepped up
								to take Roma's first penalty, but Roma captain Agostino Di Bartolomei
								took the ball from him and took the penalty instead, scoring to give Roma the lead.
								Liverpool's next penalty was taken by their regular penalty taker Neal
								who scored to level the shoot-out. Conti took the next penalty for Roma, but like Nicol
								he put his shot over the crossbar. Souness and Ubaldo Righetti
								converted their respective penalties to make the scoreline 2–2. Rush scored Liverpool's
								next penalty to make the score 3–2. Graziani stepped up again to
								take Roma's fourth penalty. While he was placing the ball on the penalty spot, Liverpool
								goalkeeper Grobbelaar was wobbling his legs in the Liverpool goal,
								hoping to distract Graziani. The tactic appeared to have worked as Graziani placed his
								penalty over the crossbar. Alan Kennedy was the next player to take
								a penalty and if he scored Liverpool would win the match. Kennedy scored the penalty
								sending Tancredi the wrong way. Liverpool won the shoot-out 4–2,
								thereby winning their fourth European Cup.</p>
